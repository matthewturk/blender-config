# Batch counterpart to constant_mass_emission_generator.py's Country Pair
# Filter mode: instead of one object per country-pair connection, this
# builds ONE multi-spline Curves object holding an emission-time curve for
# EVERY ordered pair among a set of countries that actually has matching
# data for a given item/element code - reusing hdf5_to_curves.py's own
# "one group -> one curve, combined, with a CURVE-domain identifying
# attribute" pattern (see its "Group Names" node group trick, mirrored here
# as "Pair Names", since Geometry Nodes can't read STRING attributes
# directly).
#
# Safety - five independent caps, each bounding a DIFFERENT stage, since a
# real crash showed that any one cap alone isn't enough (they can multiply):
#   1. max_countries (N) - hard cap on the Countries collection's size,
#      checked FIRST, before any data is read at all. Also bounds the raw
#      N*(N-1) possible ordered pairs.
#   2. max_reporters (N) - "Top Exporters" mode only: how many of the
#      biggest-total-export reporters get kept.
#   3. max_partners_per_reporter (M) - how many partner curves EACH kept
#      reporter may contribute (ranked by that pair's own mass). In "Top
#      Exporters" mode, total curves can never exceed max_reporters x this,
#      guaranteed - this is the literal "N x M" bound.
#   4. max_pairs - "Top Pairs by Mass" mode only: global cap on how many
#      pairs (across all reporters) get solved.
#   5. max_spheres_per_pair / max_total_spheres - bound the actual output
#      size: a per-pair cap, and a hard running budget on the SUM across
#      the whole object. This second one matters even when every other cap
#      looks reasonable alone - e.g. 500 pairs x 50,000 spheres each is 25
#      million points in one Curves object.
#
# A SEPARATE, previously-real bug (now fixed) could exhaust memory
# regardless of any of the above: reading a POINT-domain attribute's full
# array (read_full_point_attribute) copies the ENTIRE dataset every time
# it's called - if called once per reporter (5 attributes x N reporters)
# instead of once total, that's 5xN full copies of the whole dataset before
# any of the caps above even come into play. Fixed by reading each
# attribute's full array exactly once, up front, and slicing (a cheap numpy
# view) per reporter from that single cached copy.
#
# This runs in stages so it degrades gracefully instead of hard-failing
# outright:
#   - Scan: for every reporter with a valid code, find its spline once and
#     mask by item/element code once, summing its own total export mass -
#     no PCHIP solving yet. This is what ranks/restricts which reporters
#     get expanded to full per-partner detail next, in "Top Exporters" mode
#     - so the expensive per-partner expansion only ever runs for reporters
#     actually kept.
#   - Expand partners: for each kept reporter, scan every partner, rank
#     THAT reporter's own matching partners by pair mass, and keep only the
#     top max_partners_per_reporter (M) of them.
#   - Rank: sort every pair that had matching data by total mass,
#     descending - in "Top Pairs" mode this also truncates to max_pairs; in
#     "Top Exporters" mode nothing is truncated here (the sort just means
#     bigger pairs are tried first if the total-spheres budget runs out).
#   - Dry run (optional): estimate each kept pair's sphere count (the exact
#     total_mass // Mass Per Sphere formula the real solver uses) without
#     running the actual solver or writing anything - see dry_run below.
#   - Solve (expensive): run the real PCHIP computation only for the kept
#     pairs, in descending-mass order, checking the max_total_spheres
#     running budget before each one. A pair that would blow the per-pair
#     cap OR push the running total over budget is skipped (logged) rather
#     than solved anyway - later, smaller pairs are still tried in case
#     they fit what's left of the budget.
#
# Mass control is deliberately a single, fixed "Mass Per Sphere" - NOT a
# per-pair sphere count - shared across every pair in the batch. Different
# pairs have wildly different total trade volumes; a fixed sphere *count*
# per pair (which the per-connection CMET defaults to) would make a huge-
# volume pair and a tiny one look equally dense, misrepresenting relative
# scale. A fixed mass-per-sphere means bigger pairs naturally get more
# spheres, which is the point of this whole representation.
#
# Uses the same "new class of object" scoping discipline as
# constant_mass_emission_generator.py: is_cpbe_generator gates the panel and
# the depsgraph-tracking registry, and the only way to set it is the
# dedicated Add-menu operator below.
#
# Performance: the actual computation lives in _recompute_steps, a
# generator that yields a progress fraction (0..1) periodically instead of
# running start-to-finish in one call. OBJECT_OT_cpbe_generate ("Generate /
# Update Now") is a modal operator that drives this generator through a
# timer, processing a time-boxed chunk per tick so Blender's UI stays
# responsive, updating a real progress bar (Window Manager progress_begin/
# update/end), and cancellable with Esc mid-run. Callers that can't be
# modal (the depsgraph auto-update handler, the Add operator's initial
# compute) just drain the same generator in one go via
# _run_recompute_sync - same logic either way, no duplicated business
# rules between the interactive and automatic paths. The country/item/
# element code matching itself is vectorized (constant_mass_geometry_io.
# match_code_array) rather than a Python-level per-point loop, which is
# where nearly all the wall-clock time was actually going - measured at
# roughly 500x faster on a 200k-point array.
