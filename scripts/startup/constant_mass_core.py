"""Pure numeric core for constant-mass emission-time computation.

No bpy dependency on purpose, so it can be unit-tested standalone and reused
unchanged by both user_scripts/constant_mass_emission_times.py (the one-shot
script) and constant_mass_emission_generator.py (the live-tracking version) -
one place to fix, if it ever needs fixing again.

See pchip.py in the repo root for the reference algorithm this mirrors, and
either consumer file's module docstring for the full explanation of the
anchor-boundary and midpoint-centering choices.

    loop runs: solving one PCHIP root per sphere is a synchronous Python
    loop with no cancellation, so a k_max in the millions (typically from
    "Mass Per Sphere" being left at a default that's tiny relative to the
    source data's actual mass scale) doesn't error, it just blocks for a
    very long time - which looks exactly like Blender hanging. Raising
    immediately, with the actual computed numbers, is far more useful than
    letting that loop run.

    log, if given, is called with human-readable progress strings (e.g. a
    print-based debug callback) at each stage - this function stays silent
    (and the caller does whatever it wants with the messages) when log is
    None.
